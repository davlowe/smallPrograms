# Custom Array Class & Array Functions
 ✨ Here I have created a custom array records of structure class in which users may use functions to create an array,
  add/remove elements to it, print its contents, and search for a specific value within the array. 

 ✨ The user does so via a menu of prompts until they choose to exit. 

### Sample outputs:
 [Adding and printing](https://github.com/davlowe/smallPrograms/blob/main/arrayOne.png)
 
 [Searching and removing duplicate](https://github.com/davlowe/smallPrograms/blob/main/arrayTwo.png)

[Printing after duplicate is removed](https://github.com/davlowe/smallPrograms/blob/main/Array3.png)
